**Objective:** In this test, you will be required to create a responsive webpage using Tailwind CSS and integrate Tailwind UI components. You'll also need to demonstrate your understanding of key Tailwind concepts and best practices.

**Instructions:**
1. Create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and a CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) for this test.

2. Use the following HTML structure as a starting point:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.16/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <title>Tailwind CSS Test</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

3. Implement the following tasks:

**Task 1: Basic Styling**
   - Create a container with a background color of `bg-blue-300`, padding, and margin.
   - Inside the container, add a heading with text "Tailwind CSS Test" and center it.
   - Style the heading using Tailwind CSS classes.
   
**Task 2: Responsive Design**
   - Make sure the webpage is responsive and adjusts well to various screen sizes.
   - Utilize Tailwind's responsive classes (e.g., `lg:`, `md:`, `sm:`) to make layout adjustments.
   
**Task 3: Hover and Focus States**
   - Create a button with the text "Hover Me."
   - Apply Tailwind classes to change the button's background color when hovered over and when focused.
   
**Task 4: Dark Mode**
   - Implement a dark mode toggle button.
   - Use Tailwind classes and JavaScript to switch between light and dark mode.
   
**Task 5: Reusing Styles**
   - Create a card component with a shadow, padding, and margin.
   - Reuse this card component to display multiple cards on the webpage.
   
**Task 6: Adding Custom Styles**
   - Add custom CSS rules in your `styles.css` file to customize the appearance of any component on the page.
   
**Task 7: Tailwind UI Integration**
   - Integrate at least one Tailwind UI component (e.g., a navigation bar, modal, or dropdown) into your webpage.
   - Customize the component to match the overall look and feel of your webpage.

**Task 8: Theme Configuration**
   - Configure a custom color theme in your Tailwind CSS configuration file.
   - Apply the custom colors to elements on your webpage.
