**Task 1: Setting Up a Nuxt 3 Project**

- Create a new Nuxt 3 project from scratch.
- Implement a project structure that incorporates various modules for the upcoming tasks.
- Configure routing for the following pages:
  - `/` (Homepage)
  - `/about` (About page)
  - `/posts` (List of blog posts)
  - `/posts/:id` (Individual blog post)
- Implement an internationalization feature to support at least two languages (e.g., English and French).
- Create a custom navigation bar that allows language switching and navigation between these routes.

**Task 2: Data Fetching and Store**

- Create a store using Pinia.
- Fetch and store a list of mock blog posts in the store. The data should include titles, authors, and content.
- Fetch individual blog post data when the user navigates to the `/posts/:id` route.
- Use asyncData or fetch() to retrieve data on the server side when visiting the blog post pages.

**Task 3: Layouts and Middleware**

- Create custom layouts for the homepage and blog post pages.
- Implement middleware that checks whether a user is authenticated before allowing access to the `/posts` and `/posts/:id` routes.
- Create a login page at `/login` and a registration page at `/register`.

**Task 4: Authentication and Authorization**

- Integrate user authentication using Firebase Auth.
- Users should be able to register, log in, and log out.
- Ensure that only authenticated users can access the `/posts` and `/posts/:id` routes.
- Implement user roles (e.g., regular user and admin). Admins can create, edit, and delete blog posts.

**Task 5: Error Handling**

- Implement custom error pages for different types of errors (e.g., 404 Not Found and 500 Internal Server Error).
- Create error pages that respect the selected language from the i18n setup.

**Task 6: Advanced Styling**
  
- Create a visually appealing user interface for the application.

**Task 7: API Integration (Bonus)**

- Replace the mock data with a real API (e.g., REST or GraphQL) to fetch and display blog post data.
- Implement pagination for the blog post list.
